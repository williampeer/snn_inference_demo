# snn_inference

Currently a development/alpha-version.

## Usage

To run the first version of the framework integration, you may run `python main.py`, or `-h` to see available options.
Alternatively, for a much faster integration and experiment loop, you may run `python main_fast_SNN_GD_Synthetic_SGIF.py`.

See Models/ for models that are already implemented and their implementations.

Test/ for tests that you may want to run just to figure out how the Models can be used outside of the experiments context (or what happens under the hood).

exp_suite.py should give you a gist of what running an experiment does
